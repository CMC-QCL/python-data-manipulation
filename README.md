# Data Manipulation with Python

Welcome to the QCL Workshop **Data Manipulation with Python**.

By the end of this workshop you will be able to: 

* Import and export data
* Explore and subset DataFrames
* Detect and deal with missing data
* Change between data types


This is a Level 2 Workshop, so I will assume you are familiar with the topics covered in the **Practical Programming with Python** Workshop (Level 1):

* Basics of Jupyter notebook
* Variables
* Functions
* Lists and dictionaries
* For loops
* Conditional statements
